# MicroFreak BatteryPack
 Battery pack add-on for Arturia MicroFreak

The Arturia MicroFreak is a wonderful device. It can run off a USB battery pack making it a portable device. Grab your power bank, USB cable and headphones and start jamming the park, subway, or wherever. 
But we can do better. Enter MicroFreak BatteryPack. 
MFBP is an add-on that plugs into the USB port of the MF and, alleviating the need for a power bank and cable.

The MFBP takes a standard one cell 18650 3.7v Li-ion powerbank. The clip on can be 3D-printed.
The USB connectors can be vandalised from a USB cable you will have lying around. Cut off the type A and type B connectors and peel away all plastic. 

The MFBP holds firmly on the USB socket, but you can also use one or two pieces of 3.5mm wood or plastic to get additional support from two of the obscured jacks, or glue a small piece of metal on the back of the MF and install a 10mm rare earth magnet in the hole in the MFBP.

The pack can be left installed on the MF while being recharged, as long as you switch off the MF.
